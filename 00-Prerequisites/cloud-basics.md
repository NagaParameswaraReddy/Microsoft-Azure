# Cloud & Infrastructure Basics

## 1. What is Cloud?

**Definition**:  
Cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the internet, along with the software and databases that run on those servers. It allows users to store and access data and programs from anywhere, without managing physical hardware.

**Real-life Analogy**:  
Think of the cloud like electricity. You don’t generate power at home—you just plug into the grid and use it. Similarly, cloud lets you “plug into” computing resources as needed.

**Why Cloud is Popular**:  
- No upfront hardware cost  
- Scalable and flexible  
- Pay-as-you-go model  
- Accessible from anywhere

## 2. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software—over the internet (“the cloud”).

### Types:
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP)
- **Private Cloud**: Used exclusively by one organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Mix of public and private clouds

### Benefits:
- **Cost-effective** (no need to buy and maintain hardware)
- **Scalable** (resources can grow/shrink on demand)
- **Flexible** (accessible from any location)
- **Reliable** (data backup and disaster recovery options)

## 3. Types of Cloud Services

### 1. IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
- Provides virtual machines, networking, storage, etc.
- Example: Azure VM, AWS EC2

### 2. PaaS – Platform as a Service
- Provides development platforms and tools
- Example: Azure App Service, Google App Engine

### 3. SaaS – Software as a Service
- Ready-to-use software delivered via the internet
- Example: Office 365, Gmail, Salesforce

## 4. What is a Data Center?

**Definition**:  
A data center is a physical facility used by cloud providers to house computing resources like servers, storage systems, and networking equipment.

**Role in Cloud Computing**:  
Cloud providers like Microsoft Azure run massive data centers across the globe. All your cloud resources (VMs, databases, storage) physically reside in these data centers.

## 5. What is Virtualization?

**Concept of VMs (Virtual Machines)**:  
Virtualization allows you to run multiple virtual computers (VMs) on a single physical machine. Each VM acts like a separate system with its own OS and resources.

**Hypervisor**:  
A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines.  
Examples:
- Type 1: Bare-metal (e.g., Hyper-V, VMware ESXi)  
- Type 2: Hosted (e.g., VirtualBox)

## 6. What is Networking (Basic)?

### Key Concepts:
- **IP Address**: Unique ID to identify a device on a network.
- **Subnet**: A segmented piece of a larger network.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Converts domain names (e.g., azure.com) into IP addresses.

**Importance in Cloud**:  
Networking connects your cloud services, enables communication, secures traffic, and is essential for configuring resources like load balancers, firewalls, and VPNs.

## 7. Why Azure?

### Comparison:
| Feature       | Azure           | AWS              | GCP            |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Vendor        | Microsoft        | Amazon           | Google         |
| Enterprise Use| Strong presence  | Early mover      | AI-focused     |
| Hybrid Support| Excellent        | Moderate         | Limited        |

### Market Use Cases:
- Hybrid cloud with on-prem integration (Azure Arc, ExpressRoute)
- Enterprise customers with Microsoft ecosystem (Active Directory, Office 365)
- DevOps, AI, Machine Learning, and scalable application hosting
